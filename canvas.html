        <p>When you donate blood, you sit or lie on a reclining chair with your arm extended on an armrest. A healthcare provider will place a blood pressure cuff or tourniquet around your upper arm to fill your veins with more blood. After cleaning the skin on the inside of one of your elbows, the provider will insert a sterile needle attached to a thin plastic tube and blood bag into one of your veins. </p>

        <p>When a blood donation is complete, a healthcare provider will remove the needle from your vein and place a bandage on the needle site. They will wrap your arm with a dressing. The bandage and pressure of the dressing is meant to stop the blood flow out of your vein. Your nurse will instruct you to keep your bandage and dressing in place for at least four to five hours to ensure bleeding is stopped.</p>

                <p>After your donation is complete, you will be told to sit in an observation area for 15 minutes. There you will have the opportunity to rest, drink fluids — usually water or fruit juice — and eat a light snack. Eating, drinking, and resting are known to alleviate some of the dizziness, lightheadedness, and nausea that are associated with donating blood. Most people experience at least mild versions of these side effects.</p>

        <p>Donating blood isn’t a pain-free experience. You may experience pain when the needle is inserted into your arm. You shouldn’t feel any pain while the blood is being drawn, but you may experience an uncomfortable sensation at the site where the needle is inserted into your arm.</p>

        <p>LAfter donating blood, it’s likely you’ll experience some physical weakness, especially in the arm into which the needle was injected. For that reason, the nurses will advise you to avoid intense physical activity or heavy lifting for five hours after you donate blood.</p>

        <p>Donating blood can be a time-consuming process: It can take about an hour and 15 minutes, from the time you arrive to the time you leave. That includes the testing and paperwork process beforehand, where you’ll receive a physical exam and initial finger prick blood test and will need to fill out some documents. Afterward, you’ll need to sit for a 15-minute rest period. However, the blood-drawing process itself only takes about 10 minutes. Many donation centers also offer a RapidPass that you can do beforehand that will help save time.</p>
